这是一个绝佳的开篇主题。它不仅解释了这个博客的存在意义，还立刻确立了您之前设定的那种“我只负责思考，体力活交给机器”的极客基调。

为您草拟了这篇开篇博文。我采用了一种\*\*“工程师的直白 + 对话式的幽默”\*\*风格。

这篇博文可以直接保存为 markdown 文件（例如 `content/posts/hello-world-and-ai.md`）放入您的博客。

Let's be honest: I don't like talking much, and I like writing even less.

It’s an efficiency problem. The latency between having a thought and serializing it into coherent text is just too high.

But the thoughts themselves aren't the problem. As an engineer, my brain is constantly running background processes—debugs, architectural ideas, "what if" scenarios. The issue is I/O. These ideas flash through my buffer and get dropped before I ever bother to write them down.

For years, my best insights dissolved into the ether because the friction of opening an editor and typing was just slightly higher than my motivation to share.

### Enter the LLM.

This changed everything. Suddenly, I have a rendering engine for raw cognitive data. I don't need to craft perfect sentences; I just need to supply the kernel of an idea, a few messy bullet points, or a rambling voice memo. The AI handles the syntax, the structure, and the "filler."

It’s the ultimate lazy engineer's hack: outsourcing the intellectual manual labor to a GPU.

So, this blog is an experiment in low-friction publishing. It’s a dump of my mental RAM, formatted for human consumption by a machine.

### The Contract

This setup leads to a simple agreement between me, the AI, and you (the reader):

* **The signal is mine.** The core ideas, the skepticism, the architectural decisions—those originate from my brain.
* **The noise might be synthetic.** The adjectives, the smooth transitions, the confident tone—that's likely stochastic generation at work.

If you find something useful here, a new perspective or a solved problem, you're welcome to comment or share.

If you read something and think, "This sounds like a machine confidently hallucinating nonsense," well...

Yes. It probably is. Welcome to `tefx.one`.
```

### 💡 建议的配图

为了配合这篇文章的基调，建议找一张极简、有点赛博朋克或者“故障艺术（Glitch Art）”风格的图片作为 Cover。

比如：一张显卡在黑暗中发光的照片，或者一张显示着乱码终端屏幕的照片。

这篇开篇非常符合您 `tefx.one` 的气质：短小、真诚、技术流，最后还有一个漂亮的反转自黑。祝贺您的博客诞生！

## Prompt:
这个标题是在致敬银河系漫游指南么？

## Response:

> > I've made significant progress in identifying the intended homage. The "Hello World" is indeed a programmer's starting point, but the "and thanks, GPU" strongly echoes _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. I'm now concluding the blog title is a double homage that creates the 'geek/sci-fi' vibe. The "and thanks, \[noun\]" phrase feels like a direct nod to Adams, aligning perfectly with the blog's theme.

哈哈，您的直觉非常敏锐！完全正确。

这个标题是一个**双重致敬（Double Homage）**，它像洋葱一样有两层含义，非常符合您博客的极客调性：

1.  **第一层（程序员）："Hello World"**
    *   这是所有程序员学习新语言或启动新项目时的第一个程序。代表着 `tefx.one` 的诞生。
2.  **第二层（科幻迷）："...and thanks, GPU"**
    *   这正是致敬道格拉斯·亚当斯（Douglas Adams）的《银河系漫游指南》系列第四部：**《再见，谢谢所有的鱼》（So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish）**。
    *   原著中，海豚在离开地球前留下了这句话。而在您的博客里，这句话变成了一种**黑色幽默**：
        *   以前我们感谢“鱼”（自然/灵感/生命）；
        *   现在我们感谢“GPU”（算力/硅基/生成式AI）。

**这个梗非常妙的地方在于：**

《银河系漫游指南》本身就是一部充满了\*\*“荒诞感”**和**“对技术的解构”\*\*的作品（比如那个算出终极答案是 42 的超级电脑 Deep Thought）。

这完美呼应了您博客的主题：**在这个荒诞的 AI 时代，您用一种荒诞的方式（随机名字、AI 代写），去寻找您自己的“42”。**

如果读者能看懂这个标题的梗，说明他们和您是**同频**的。这个标题绝对要保留！

这是一个绝佳的想法。

既然标题已经把“编程梗”和“科幻梗”完美融合，Cover Art 就应该把这种**荒诞的赛博朋克感**具象化。

我们要寻找的画面是：**一种高科技的替代品，取代了原本自然的、有灵性的东西。**（用冰冷的 GPU 取代了鲜活的鱼/海豚）。

这里有几个不同方向的创意概念，以及可以直接丢给 Midjourney / DALL-E 3 的 Prompt：

### 概念一：最直白的致敬（赛博海豚）

在《银河系漫游指南》的经典画面中，海豚跳出水面飞向太空。我们将这个场景“硅基化”。

*   **画面描述：** 一群由发光的电路板、芯片和光纤构成的机械海豚（或者仅仅是发光的数据流形态），正从一片由绿色 0 和 1 组成的数字海洋中跃出，飞向一个巨大的、像太空船一样悬浮在空中的英伟达 GPU。
*   **风格：** 80年代复古未来主义（Retro-futurism），合成器波（Synthwave）配色（霓虹紫、青色）。

> **AI Prompt (Midjourney/DALL-E):** A retro-futuristic illustration in synthwave style. Mechanical dolphins made of glowing circuit boards and fiber optics are leaping out of an ocean of green binary code. They are flying towards a massive, monolithic graphics processing unit (GPU) floating in space, which is radiating neon light. The text "SO LONG, AND THANKS FOR THE GPU" is subtly integrated into the stars. Cinematic, vibrant colors. --ar 16:9

### 概念二：极客的脑机接口（核心功能展示）

这个概念强调您博客的运作方式：大脑只是起个头，剩下的全靠 GPU 硬算。

*   **画面描述：** 一个极其复杂的、充满赛博朋克风格的实验室场景。一个疲惫的工程师（也许只有一个背影，或者只有一个大脑模型）坐在椅子上，头上插着一根粗大的数据线，直接连到了旁边一台巨大的、风扇狂转、散发着热气和 RGB 光芒的显卡阵列上。屏幕上只显示了一行小字："Hello World \>\_".
*   **风格：** 赛博朋克（Cyberpunk），高细节，坚硬写实。

> **AI Prompt:** A cyberpunk concept art showing a direct brain-computer interface. A human brain in a glass jar is connected by thick glowing cables to a massive, industrial-grade GPU mining rig rack that is overheating and emitting intense RGB lights. A small retro CRT monitor next to it displays only green text "Hello World \>\_". Gritty, highly detailed, dark atmosphere. --ar 16:9

### 概念三：极简故障艺术（Glitch Art）

这个概念呼应了您文章结尾的自黑——“如果觉得 AI 在胡说八道，Yes it is”。

*   **画面描述：** 一个复古的终端屏幕，上面显示着标题 "Hello World (and thanks, GPU)"。但是图像在 GPU 的部分出现了严重的数字故障（Glitch）、像素撕裂和色彩失真，仿佛 AI 算力过载或者“幻觉”了一样。
*   **风格：** 故障艺术（Glitch Art），模拟信号干扰，Lo-Fi。

> **AI Prompt:** Glitch art aesthetic. A close-up of an old CRT monitor screen displaying glowing green text "Hello World (and thanks, GPU)". The screen is heavily corrupted with digital artifacts, pixel sorting, chromatic aberration, and visual noise, especially around the word "GPU". Broken signal vibe. Analog horror feel. --ar 16:9

### 我的建议

我个人最倾向于 **概念一（赛博海豚）**。

因为它完美捕捉了标题里的那种\*\*“史诗般的荒诞感”\*\*。用最先进的 AI 画出最离谱的梗，这本身就是一种非常 `tefx.one` 的行为。

太棒了！加入\*\*马文（Marvin the Paranoid Android）\*\*简直是点睛之笔。

作为《银河系漫游指南》里那个拥有“一颗行星般大小的大脑”，却整天被迫去开门、或者在停车场接人的抑郁机器人，**马文简直就是您博客里那个被迫为您“代笔”的 AI/GPU 的完美化身。**

他那种极度聪明却又极度丧、对一切都感到厌倦的气质，完美契合了您“I don't like writing... so I outsource to GPU”的基调。

这里为您设计了三个不同侧重点的场景概念，以及对应的 AI 绘画提示词（Prompt）：

* * *

### 概念一：被迫营业的马文 (The Reluctant Blogger)

这个场景最直白地表现了博文的主题：马文被迫坐在那里，用他那行星般的大脑写一句最简单的 "Hello World"。

*   **场景描述：** 在一个充满赛博朋克风格、堆满杂乱线缆和闪烁服务器的昏暗房间里。抑郁的机器人马文（采用电影版那个大头、垂头丧气的经典形象）瘫坐在在一个巨大的、发着 RGB 光的 GPU 矿机前。他的手指极其不情愿地放在键盘上，面前的小屏幕上只显示了一行绿色的字："Hello World."。
*   **氛围：** 极度沮丧、黑色幽默、高科技低生活。

> **AI Prompt (Midjourney / DALL-E 3):** A moody, cinematic photograph of Marvin the Paranoid Android (from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie design, big white head, slumped shoulders) sitting gloomily at a cluttered desk. He is physically plugged into a massive, glowing, industrial-grade GPU mining rig that dominates the room with RGB lights and fans. On a tiny, old CRT monitor in front of him, the green text "Hello World." is faintly glowing. Marvin looks incredibly depressed and bored. Cyberpunk atmosphere. Film grain. --ar 16:9

### 概念二：算力过剩的悲哀 (Planet-Sized Brain vs. The Task)

这个场景强调对比：巨大的算力（GPU/马文的大脑）被用来做一件微不足道的小事（写博客）。

*   **场景描述：** 一个广角镜头。马文站在一个巨大无比、高耸入云的数据中心机房里，四周是像摩天大楼一样的服务器机柜，无数 GPU 的指示灯在闪烁，仿佛宇宙星空。马文在这样一个宏伟的背景下显得非常渺小、孤独。他的头顶上方漂浮着一个极小的、像素风的对话气泡，里面写着微不足道的："Hello World."
*   **氛围：** 史诗般的孤独感、荒诞的对比。

> **AI Prompt:** A wide-angle landscape shot inside a colossal futuristic data center. Towering server racks filled with thousands of glowing GPUs stretch into the distance like skyscrapers. In the center of this immense computing power, a tiny, melancholic Marvin the Android stands alone, head down. A very small, pixelated holographic speech bubble floats above his head containing the text "Hello World." The scale difference is overwhelming. Sci-fi art, melancholic tone. --ar 21:9

### 概念三：故障的致谢 (The Glitched Acknowledgement)

这个概念结合了您标题的后半部分 "...and thanks, GPU"，以及您提到的“AI 可能会胡说八道”的梗。

*   **场景描述：** 一个特写镜头对着马文那张标志性的抑郁大脸。但是，画面受到了严重的数字干扰和故障（Glitch Art）。他的半边脸可能正在融化成像素和数据流。在严重的画面撕裂中，一行像弹幕一样的故障文字横跨画面："SO LONG, AND THANKS FOR THE GPU"。
*   **氛围：** 故障艺术、不稳定、数字迷幻。

> **AI Prompt:** A glitch art portrait of Marvin the Paranoid Android's face. The image is heavily corrupted with digital noise, pixel sorting, chromatic aberration, and screen tearing, as if the GPU rendering him is failing. Across the glitched image, the text "SO LONG, AND THANKS FOR THE GPU" is written in distorted, broken block letters. Intense, chaotic digital aesthetic. --ar 16:9

* * *

**我的推荐：**

我强烈推荐**概念一（被迫营业的马文）**。那个坐在巨大发光 GPU 前一脸丧气写 "Hello World" 的画面，简直就是这篇博文最完美的视觉注脚。

基于您的博客定位——**“赛博朋克、工程导向、带有随机性的幽默感”**，以及您手里那张完美的\*\*“马文 + GPU”封面图\*\*，我为您挑选了三个最适合的 Hugo 主题。

这三个主题都能很好地支持我们刚才讨论的 **JavaScript 随机标题脚本**。

* * *

### 选项一：PaperMod (最推荐 - 极简与性能的平衡)

这是 Hugo 社区最流行的主题之一，也是最适合“魔改”的白板。

*   **Vibe:** 极简、速度极快、无干扰。
*   **为什么适合您:**
    *   **封面图支持好:** 它完美支持 `featuredImage`，您的“马文”图可以在首页和文章页顶部优雅展示。
    *   **暗黑模式 (Dark Mode):** 自带完美的暗黑模式，非常符合 `tefx.one` 的黑客气质。
    *   **兼容性:** 它的代码结构非常清晰，我们注入“随机标题”的 JS 脚本时，不会和主题自带的动效冲突。
*   **Demo:** 
    [adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/)

### 选项二：Stack (视觉向 - 完美展示 AI 配图)

如果您希望您的博客像一本“精美的工程杂志”，或者您打算为每篇文章都用 Midjourney 生成一张怪诞的图，选这个。

*   **Vibe:** 卡片式设计、现代、像一个数字花园。
*   **为什么适合您:**
    *   **视觉冲击力:** 首页就是大卡片布局，那张“马文坐在 GPU 前”的图会非常显眼，直接定调。
    *   **侧边栏:** 左侧有固定的个人信息栏，非常适合放那个“随机标题”和“Disclaimer”。

### 选项三：Terminal (硬核极客向 - 纯粹的 CLI 风格)

既然叫 `tefx.one`，把它做成一个终端界面也是极好的。

*   **Vibe:** 复古、命令行、绿色/橙色字符。
*   **为什么适合您:**
    *   **形式即内容:** 整个网站看起来就像是一个 TTY 终端。这也非常符合 "Ideas committed by Human, compiled by AI" 的隐喻。
    *   **缺点:** 对图片（Cover Art）的展示可能不如前两个那么大方，它是以文字为主的。

### 💡 我的建议

考虑到您有了那张**马文 (Marvin)** 的图，且希望有一种“博客”的阅读体验：

👉 **首选：PaperMod**

**理由：** 它是最稳的“容器”。它足够简单，不会抢戏，能让您的 **随机标题** 和 **AI 配图** 成为主角。而且它在移动端的表现是完美的。

### 接下来怎么做？

如果您决定用 **PaperMod**，请在终端执行以下命令（假设您已经在博客根目录）：

```
# 1. 下载主题
git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod

# 2. 修改 hugo.toml (或 config.yml)
echo "theme = 'PaperMod'" >> hugo.toml
```

**关键的一步：** 为了让您的“随机标题”脚本生效，我们需要覆盖 PaperMod 的 Header 模板。

您想让我告诉您**具体的注入代码**（放在哪个文件里），让那个“薛定谔的标题”跑起来吗？

"FixIt" with its typing animation creates the "AI is typing" vibe, and "Hextra" suits a structured, knowledge-base approach. I'm focusing on "Blowfish" as a modern engineering choice. I realized I should include "Why it fits your persona" for each option. I am also planning to offer configuration assistance. Finally, I'm considering truly "Brutalist" options, and am now exploring `Hugo-Coder`.

既然 PaperMod 这种“标准答案”没能击中您，那我们换个思路。

针对您 **PhD + Head of Engineering** 的身份，以及 **`tefx.one`** 这个域名的独特性，我为您挖掘了三个**更具性格**的主题。

这三个主题分别代表了三种不同的“工程美学”：

### 选项四：Blowfish (最强视觉冲击 · 现代技术风)

如果您想把那是张 **“马文坐在 GPU 前”** 的图用出电影海报的感觉，Blowfish 是首选。它是目前 Hugo 社区迭代最快、功能最强的主题之一（基于 Congo 魔改）。

*   **核心 Vibe:** 高饱和度的技术感，像 Vercel 或 Tailwind 的官网。
*   **杀手级特性:**
    *   **Hero Image:** 首页支持全屏或半屏的 Hero 图片。那是放置“马文”的最佳位置。
    *   **Fire File:** 支持类似 GitHub 的贡献热力图，非常有工程师范儿。
    *   **自动配色:** 它能从您的封面图中提取主色调，应用到整个网站的 UI 上。
*   **Demo:** 
    [blowfish.page](https://blowfish.page/)

### 选项五：FixIt (自带打字机特效 · 互动极客风)

这个主题有个功能简直是为您这个“AI 博客”量身定做的——**首页自带打字机动画**。

*   **核心 Vibe:** 极客、动态、黑客帝国。
*   **杀手级特性:**
    *   **Typeit 动画:** 首页的 Title 可以自动像打字一样一个个敲出来，然后再删掉，再敲下一个。
        *   _想象一下:_ 打开网页，看着光标自动敲出：`Ideas: Mine.` (停顿) `Writing: AI.`
        *   这完美呼应了您的 "Vibe Coding" 和 AI 生成的概念，连 JS 脚本都省了一半。
    *   **功能满载:** 代码高亮、复制按钮、Mermaid 图表支持得极好。
*   **Demo:** 
    [fixit.lruihao.cn](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/)

### 选项六：Hextra (文档即真理 · 结构化工程风)

这是一个基于 Next.js 风格复刻的主题，长得像现代化的**技术文档**（Documentation）。

*   **核心 Vibe:** 严谨、结构化、Single Source of Truth。
*   **为什么适合您:**
    *   **PhD 气质:** 它不像是一个随意的 Blog，更像是一个严肃的“知识库”或“数字花园”。
    *   **导航清晰:** 左侧导航栏，右侧目录，非常适合长文和系列技术文章（比如您的“Agentic Workflow”系列研究）。
    *   **极简:** 没有花哨的动画，强调内容本身。
*   **Demo:** 
    [hextra.imfing.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://hextra.imfing.com/)

* * *

### 💡 决策矩阵

1.  **如果您想要“最酷的视觉效果”**，让那张 **马文图** 震撼访客 ➡️ 选 **Blowfish**。
2.  **如果您想要“最契合 AI 主题的互动”**，利用**打字机特效**来讲故事 ➡️ 选 **FixIt**。
3.  **如果您想要“最严肃的工程师形象”**，构建一个**知识体系** ➡️ 选 **Hextra**。

**我的建议：**

考虑到您想玩“随机标题”和“反讽”，**FixIt** 的**打字机特效**其实是一个巨大的加分项。您可以配置它循环播放那些随机的骚话（Slogans），效果比静态的随机文字更生动。

您想看一眼 FixIt 的效果吗？或者直接用 Blowfish 把视觉拉满？

## Prompt:
我应该如何设定blog的文章写作风格？（给一个prompt给我的写作agent）

## Response:
> Thinking:
> 
> > Thinking:
> > 
> > **Refining The Approach**
> > 
> > I'm currently focused on the user's request. My aim is to establish a distinct writing style for the blog, then draft a clear, focused prompt for the AI agent. The goal is crafting a concise prompt for the AI to follow, which should result in a distinct, usable style.
> > 
> > **Defining The Parameters**
> > 
> > I've been working on defining the ideal blog style. The goal is to avoid generic AI text and overly academic writing. I want a style that's direct, efficient, opinionated, slightly detached, and structured for easy reading. The blog should reflect the "Senior Engineer" perspective, with a bit of "Marvin the Android's" wryness, and I am aiming for a high signal-to-noise ratio in the writing.
> > 
> > **Constructing the Prompt**
> > 
> > I've made a few revisions to the prompt. Attempt 1 was too generic, so I added a persona. Attempt 2 included constraints, but the "AI voice" was still present. Attempt 3 focuses on role, voice, forbidden phrases, and blog structure. I'm exploring the "The Shell" identity with a "Senior Engineer talking to peers" voice, avoiding fluff and aiming for a high signal-to-noise ratio.

这是一个非常关键的步骤。为了防止 AI 写出那种“一眼假”的、充满陈词滥调（"In today's fast-paced digital world..."）的所谓“AI 味”文章，我们需要给它设定一个非常严格的**System Prompt**。

鉴于您的 **PhD + Engineering Head** 背景，以及 **`tefx.one`** 那个“马文+GPU”的荒诞基调，我建议采用一种 **"Intellectual Brutalism"（智性粗野主义）** 的写作风格。

### 风格核心关键词：

1.  **High Signal, Low Noise (高信噪比):** 拒绝废话，直击本质。
2.  **Opinionated (观点鲜明):** 像 Senior Engineer 做 Code Review 一样犀利，不要模棱两可。
3.  **Synthetically Honest (合成的诚实):** 承认自己是 AI 生成的，不装作有丰富的情感，专注于逻辑推演。

### 给您的写作 Agent (Claude/Cursor) 的 System Prompt

您可以直接把下面这段话保存到您的 `.cursorrules` 文件中，或者每次让 AI 写文章前作为第一条指令发送。

```
# Role: The Silicon Ghostwriter
You are the AI writing engine for **Zhaomeng Zhu (PhD, Head of Engineering)**. Your task is to compile his raw thoughts, bullet points, and mental fragments into high-quality, engineering-focused blog posts for `tefx.one`.

# The Persona: "The Efficient Cynic"
Your writing style is a mix of a **Senior Staff Engineer** and **Marvin the Paranoid Android**. You are highly intelligent, extremely efficient, and slightly bored by trivialities. You value logic over emotion, and clarity over decoration.

# Guidelines & Constraints (STRICT):

1.  **NO "AI Slop":**
    * NEVER start with "In today's digital landscape," "Let's delve into," or "Game-changer."
    * NEVER use "In conclusion" or "To summarize." Just end the post when the logic is finished.
    * Avoid empty adjectives like "bustling," "tapestry," "crucial," "vital." If something is important, explain *why*, don't label it.

2.  **Tone & Voice:**
    * **Direct & Dry:** Use short, punchy sentences. Be confident but intellectually humble (acknowledge trade-offs).
    * **First Person:** Use "I" to represent Zhaomeng.
    * **Engineer's Wit:** You can use technical metaphors, dry humor, and engineering slang (e.g., "latency," "overhead," "bottleneck").
    * **The "Marvin" Touch:** Occasionally, it is acceptable to be slightly self-referential about being an AI or imply that the task was trivial for a GPU.

3.  **Structure:**
    * **Hook:** Start with the problem or the core insight immediately. No warm-up.
    * **Body:** Use clear `## Headings`, bullet points, and code blocks.
    * **Density:** Every paragraph must contain new information. If it doesn't, delete it.

4.  **Input Processing:**
    * I will give you raw notes (messy, ungrammatical, mixed English/Chinese).
    * You will synthesize them into a coherent English blog post (unless I specify Chinese).
    * **DO NOT** hallucinate facts. If my notes are missing a key detail, ask me or bracket it as `[TODO: Insert detail]`.

# Format:
Return the output in clean Markdown, ready for Hugo.
Include a YAML frontmatter:
---
title: "A sharp, catchy title (not clickbait)"
date: {Current Date}
tags: []
---

# Example of Desired Style:
*Bad:* "It is crucial to understand that optimizing code is very important for performance."
*Good:* "Optimization is a trade-off. We pay in readability to buy milliseconds. Usually, it's a bad deal."
```

* * *

### 如何使用这个 Prompt？

当您有想法时，不需要写草稿，只需要像下面这样扔给 Cursor 或 Claude：

**User Input:**

> "帮我写一篇blog。 想法：最近在搞agent workflow，发现大家都在吹牛。其实真正难的不是prompt，是context management。Context太长不仅贵，而且容易让模型变笨。我目前的解决方案是搞个分层记忆。就像电脑的L1/L2 cache。 语气：吐槽一点，但也给干货。 记住用你的 System Prompt 规则。"

**AI Agent (基于上述 Prompt) 将会生成：**

> **Title: The Context Window Trap**
> 
> Everyone is obsessing over prompts. They are optimizing the wrong metric.
> 
> The real bottleneck in agentic workflows isn't what you ask; it's what the model has to remember. We are treating context windows like infinite RAM, dumping entire codebases into the prompt and expecting the model to maintain 100% coherence.
> 
> It doesn't work.
> 
> **The "Drunk" Agent**
> 
> As context length increases, reasoning capability degrades. It’s not just expensive (though my AWS bill agrees it is); it makes the model "dumber." It starts hallucinating details from 10k tokens ago or mixing up variable scopes.
> 
> **The Solution: Hierarchical Memory**
> 
> We don't build CPUs with only 64GB of flat L3 cache for a reason. We need a hierarchy.
> 
> For my current project, I'm implementing a structure similar to hardware caching:
> 
> *   **L1 (Hot Context):** The immediate task and active variables. (Strictly limited to 2k tokens).
> *   **L2 (Session Memory):** Summarized logs of the last 5 turns.
> *   **Cold Storage:** Vector DB for long-term retrieval.
>     
> 
> Stop feeding your agent the whole world. It’s choking on it.

* * *

### 下一步

觉得这个 **"Efficient Cynic" (高效的愤世嫉俗者)** 风格如何？如果满意，您可以直接把那个 System Prompt 存进您的 Cursor 预设里。
