Let's be honest: I don't like talking much, and I like writing even less.

It’s an efficiency problem. The latency between having a thought and serializing it into coherent text is just too high.

But the thoughts themselves aren't the problem. As an engineer, my brain is constantly running background processes—debugs, architectural ideas, "what if" scenarios. The issue is I/O. These ideas flash through my buffer and get dropped before I ever bother to write them down.

For years, my best insights dissolved into the ether because the friction of opening an editor and typing was just slightly higher than my motivation to share.

### Enter the LLM.

This changed everything. Suddenly, I have a rendering engine for raw cognitive data. I don't need to craft perfect sentences; I just need to supply the kernel of an idea, a few messy bullet points, or a rambling voice memo. The AI handles the syntax, the structure, and the "filler."

It’s the ultimate lazy engineer's hack: outsourcing the intellectual manual labor to a GPU.

So, this blog is an experiment in low-friction publishing. It’s a dump of my mental RAM, formatted for human consumption by a machine.

### The Contract

This setup leads to a simple agreement between me, the AI, and you (the reader):

* **The signal is mine.** The core ideas, the skepticism, the architectural decisions—those originate from my brain.
* **The noise might be synthetic.** The adjectives, the smooth transitions, the confident tone—that's likely stochastic generation at work.

If you find something useful here, a new perspective or a solved problem, you're welcome to comment or share.

If you read something and think, "This sounds like a machine confidently hallucinating nonsense," well...

Yes. It probably is. Welcome to `tefx.one`.
